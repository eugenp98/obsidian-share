# Co-Memo-S: WP3

## Video Production Workflow

This step-by-step process outlines the creative and technical workflow for producing each of the five animated videos. Each video will follow this structured path from concept to completion. 

1. **Blueprint & Script Finalization**
    For each video, I started to refine the scene-by-scene breakdown to create a final production blueprint. This includes locking in the visual concepts for every scene and finalizing the voiceover script to ensure it aligns perfectly with the planned visuals and timing. The breakdown of the scenes along with a description of the details that are to be included for each of them can be found at the following link:

2. **Voiceover Recording**
    The voiceover for all five animations is being recorded in a professional music studio in the Timișoara Youth House. The audio track will serve as the foundational timeline and pacing guides for all the videos, ensuring that all animations are synchronized precisely with the narration. 

3. **Visual Asset Production** 
    This is the core animation phase where two parallel processes occur: 
    - Krita Drawing Timelapses: I will create artistic, hand-drawn timelapse sequences for the conceptual and narrative scenes. 
    - Motion Graphics: I will design and animate clean, modern graphics for titles, statistics, and key textual information. 
    
    The overall aesthetic for the animation is a dynamic blend of modern clarity and artistic, handcrafted storytelling.
    
    Key data and statistics will be presented using clean, minimalist motion graphics to ensure information is clear and digestible. This is contrasted by the core visual style: striking timelapse drawings on a black background. Using a textured, pencil-like line in white with carefully chosen accent colors, these animations will bring complex concepts to life with an organic, human touch that come off as deeply personal.
    
    To get a better idea, you can consult the moodboard:

4. **Assembly & First Edit**
    Once the visual assets are ready, I will assemble the first cut of the video. This involves sequencing the Krita timelapses and motion graphics according to the blueprint and synchronizing them with the voiceover track. 

5. **Sound Design & Music**
    To enhance the viewing experience, I will then layer in a suitable music bed and subtle sound effects. This step adds emotional depth and professional polish to the final product. 

6. **Review, Revisions & Finalization** 
    The complete video drafts will be shared for review.
